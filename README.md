Github Action to test or check outputs of CLI commands üïµÔ∏è‚öôÔ∏èüñ•

*Note: This action gather the [command-output-file-action](https://github.com/GuillaumeFalourd/command-output-file-action) and the [diff-action](https://github.com/GuillaumeFalourd/diff-action)*

* * *

## üìö Usage

**actions/checkout**

The [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout) is mandatory to use this action, as it will be necessary to access the repository files, or to access the output file after the action execution.

**Expected Behaviours**

Workflow will **COMPLETE** if the `diff` output of the command and the assert file is **equal** to the `expected_result` input value.

Workflow will **FAIL** if the `diff` output of the command and the assert file is **different** than the `expected_result` input value.

 * * *

### Scenarios

#### Expecting command output to be EQUAL to assert.txt file content

```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.4
      - uses: GuillaumeFalourd/test-cli-commands-action@v1
        with:
          command_line: ls -lha
          assert_file_name: assert.txt
          expected_result: PASSED
```

#### Expecting command output to be DIFFERENT than the assert.txt file content

```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.4
      - uses: GuillaumeFalourd/test-cli-commands-action@v1
        with:
          command_line: ls -lha
          assert_file_name: assert.txt
          expected_result: FAILED
```

#### Expecting command output line 3 to be EQUAL than the assert.txt file content in line 3

```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.4
      - uses: GuillaumeFalourd/test-cli-commands-action@v1
        with:
          command_line: ls -lha
          assert_file_name: assert.txt
          expected_result: PASSED
          specific_line: 3
```

#### Expecting command output line 3 to be DIFFERENT than the assert.txt file content in line 3

```yaml
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.4
      - uses: GuillaumeFalourd/test-cli-commands-action@v1
        with:
          command_line: ls -lha
          assert_file_name: assert.txt
          expected_result: FAILED
          specific_line: 3
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Action Inputs

Field | Mandatory | Observation
------------ | ------------  | -------------
**command_line** | YES | ex: `ls -lha`
**assert_file_path** | YES | ex: `path/to/assert.txt`
**expected_result** | NO | `PASSED` (default) or `FAILED`
**specific_line** | NO | ex: `1` (integer value only)

_NOTE: You can then access the **output.txt file** in the repository directory **where you ran the action**._
